This generates the numbers to print on cards to do a magic trick.  
The trick goes something like this:

Lay 7 cards out on a table.  The cards are covered with numbers. 
Ask a volunteer for a number between 1 and 100.  Then ask the 
volunteer to indicate which cards that number appears on.

The first number on each card is a power of two - 1, 2, 4, 8,
and so on.  Add those numbers together for each card that the
volunteer indicates.  The sum is the number the volunteer is
thinking of.

How it works: Basically, you are treating the cards the volunteer
indicates as 1's and the not-indicated cards as 0's.  This gives
you the binary representation of the number he's thinking of.  
By adding the powers of two for the 1's, you are converting the
binary number to decimal.

Now, proclaim the number in your most theatrical magician voice.  
Don't worry that people might think that voice is dorky -- you 
are already running a perl script to help with a magic trick that 
involves converting binary to decimal.  The dork ship has sailed.
